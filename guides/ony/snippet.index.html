<h1>Onyxia in a Nutshell</h1>

<p>Fight has three phases:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Ground phase: Don't overaggro, watch tail, don't get knocked into whelps!</li>
    <li>Air phase: Spread, fireballs reset aggro! Dodge "Deep Breath" ability (see chart below)! Melee clear whelps!</li>
    <li>Ground phase: Wait for tank to get aggro, run to tank spot if you have aggro! Clear whelps!</li>
</ol>

<h2>P2: Deep breaths</h2>
