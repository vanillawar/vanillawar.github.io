<h1>Kronos Tanking Compendium</h1>

<p>On Classic vs. Kronos: In general, Classic tanking is a joke. On Kronos most stuff feels like it hits harder, this is partially due to mob ability spam and something being off with melee combat in general (e.g. dodge/avoidance is way more consistent on Classic, thrashing and parry-hasting and generall weird dmg spikes are way more common on Kronos. On Classic you also don't need more than 6% hit due to HS queueing (assuming you have at least +5 weap skill).</p>

<p>On Alliance vs. Horde: Alliance tanking is easy-mode with BoK, BoS, BoP, Fearward, DI. On Horde you just can't outthreat BiS warriors with windfury if they aren't playing along in critical/unlucky situations (e.g. by using fetish, petri flask, LIP or target dummies).</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<ul>
    <li>On race selection: For 98% of players human/orc are the best choice. Troll works too for top guild MTs getting fed or if you have beaten the game (= obtained THC+TF). Gnome is a valid choice if you intend to gear through PvP (r13 is valid tank set for majority of content, esp. if augmented with defensive offpieces for certain encounters, r14 weaps work till Naxx/KT). UD is nice for Nef/Ony due to additional fear break. Dwarf is also nice for certain encounters. Remember there's a time-component to the game and humans/orcs/gnome just breeze through the game faster than other races, so it's easier to stay ahead of the curve.</li>
    <li>On talents: PvP Arms or Furyimpale for leveling/dungeon content. 1-2 furyprot tanks for raids.</li>
    <li>On weapon speed: doesn't matter much outside of Vael/Thaddius where you got more rage than you can dump. Generally, two fast weapons are more reliable/consistent and slower weapons have a higher variance. If undergeared/underbuffed, fast weapons can actually hinder you if you don't generate enough rage with a signle hit to use e.g. Revenge or SA. Ideally, use weapons you have at least +5 weapon skill with.</li>
    <li>On BiS/default TPS gear: get 2 pieces T3 for revenge bonus (good T3 pieces are bracers, head, boots, chest and ring). Maximize stamina, armor (= effective health, EH) and DPS stats, 40-50 +def, 10-12% +hit. Too much +def reduces you enrage uptime, thus threat. You want to find the sweet spot of not getting crit-crushed to death and getting crit regularly for enrage.</li>
    <li>General skill priorities as furyprot: rage pooled with HS queued, BT > Revenge > Sunder armor/BS to dump rage. As OT spam sunder after the initial BT to bind your mob, keep DS up.</li>
    <li>As full epic warrior without a shield has the same amount of armor as a full-blue/preraid BiS warrior with a shield.</li>
    <li>There is no "aoe tanking" in Vanilla: For the few AoE packs (Garr adds, BWL gobbos/whelps, AQ40 warriors, Naxx spiders), you have sappers and AoE taunt (mb engi shield). You can at most bind 2-3 mobs and more shouldn't be needed either.</li>
    <li>Generally, you want to dual wield as much as possible. Have dual wield and 1h+shield keybound and ideally on the other hand as your ability spam (e.g. I have weapon/gear switch on left keyboard hand and majority of abilities on right mouse hand). If you dip hard, switch to 1H+Shield immediately. <b>Use the same MH in your dual wield setup as well as in your 1H+Shield setup so you don't trigger GCD when switching weapons.</b></li>
    <li>Nearly all encounters you want to pop your TPS/DPS CDs on pull (mostly Death Wish and CD trinkets), maybe sapper/holy water/dense dynamite if you set fit</li>
    <li>4 main consumable buffs you want to have up at all times: mongoose, green juju, black juju (alt: firewater), dumplings (alt: sunfruit, stam food)</li>
</ul>

<h2>More on BiS Gear by Slot</h2>

<p>
    Actually, you got lots of options gearing as a tank, most important is having full epic armor and epic weapons.
    Despite the good AQ40 offpieces (gloves, belt, shoulders), T3 has the highest EH. So if it comes hard-on-hard and full potato is required, use T3.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Head: T3 or T2.5 or r13. Progression: skip LHH, go straight for T1/T2/r10, save Arcanite for TF or gold for epic mount.</li>
    <li>Neck: Stormrage or Barbed for TPS, Cthun neck for max. potato. ZG set neck and Ony neck are great starters. Skeram and Gothik necks are fine as well. AV neck, DMF neck are great catch-ups.</li>
    <li>Shoulder: T2.5 or r13. T3 or Unrelenting for potato.</li>
    <li>Cloak: Cthun Eye cloak, Contrated Hatred, Cloak of the Scourge, AQ20 set cloak. ZG hit cloak is fine, too.</li>
    <li>Chest: T2.5 or r13. Use T3 chest if you need hit (e.g. no DFT) or T3 set bonus.</li>
    <li>Bracers: T3. Vengeance work, too.</li>
    <li>Gloves: GoA, Steadfast work, too.</li>
    <li>Belt: Mentor, Royal Qiraji Belt.</li>
    <li>Legs: T2.5 or r12.</li>
    <li>Boots: Chromatics or r12 or T3.</li>
    <li>Rings: Plenty of options, anything with melee stats and epic works.</li>
    <li>Trinkets: Kiss, DFT, Slayer's, MotC, LGG, ZG set trinket, Styleen's, Diamond Flask, Earthstrike.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leveling / Dungeons</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Best tanked as Arms or Furyimpale specs due to having both TM and PH.</li>
    <li>SA is your friend, try to mark mobs. Build threat on a different mob than skull, let DPS nuke skull and taunt skull. This way you can bind 2-3 mobs.</li>
    <li>Kite groups of mobs with PH, PH also buys you time to taunt before e.g. Strat UD ghoul packs reach ranged DPS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Molten Core</h2>

<h3>Magmadar</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Open with Death Wish, avoid subsequent fears with Berserker Rage/Fearward</li>
    <li>Progression: Use shield/Draconian Deflector at all times, GSSP</li>
</ul>

<h3>Majordomo</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Maybe not use TF with spellreflect.</li>
    <li>Progression: go full potato as Elite OT.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ragnaros</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ideally have 315 FR. Death Wish ~8s before start, MRP on start.</li>
    <li>ZG rage trinket helps too get rage before encounter starts.</li>
    <li>Progression: Get BRS FR buff, don't Death Wish on pull, GFPP before pull, MRP on start, use Draconian Deflector</li>
</ul>

<h2>Onyxia</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Start with MRP on pull, use CD trinket in P1, DW upon landing P3, use 2nd CD trinket P3 if you have. 2H+Slam in P2, keep SA up in P2 (if no EA rogue).</li>
    <li>On threat reset through fireballs isn't really working on Kronos. P1 tank almost never gets to pickup on P3 regardless of what's done in P2.</li>
    <li>Progression: Use shield/Draconian Deflector, mb some FR pieces, shield block/defensive CDs after breaths. It's great to have 2nd tank stay mid-level on KTM till P2/P3, so 2nd tank is likely to pick it up in P3.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blackwing Lair</h2>

<h3>Chromaggus</h3>
<ul>
    <li>MRP on pull if you struggle with threat, GSSP after that.</li>
    <li>Ideally, avoid Timelapse and 2nd Ignite flesh stack (avoid by running out of LoS while Chromaggus is casting the breath)</li>
    <li>Progression: Go full potato, GSSP up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nefarian</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Slightly more tanky than default TPS set (swap out 2-3 pieces).Onyxia Scale Cloak.</li>
    <li>Get ready to pick it up ca. 3-5s after 3rd big guy spawns.</li>
    <li>Shield after shadow flame, shield for warrior call.</li>
    <li>Dmg variance is high on this encounter: it ranged from def stance+shield to berserker stance+recklessness up to break fear. In that case you may want to cancel recklessness prematurely.</li>
    <li>Use GSSP, esp. when dual wielding.</li>
    <li>Progression: be tanky, maybe even full-potato on Horde, GSSP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zul'Gurub</h2>

<h3>Spider boss</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mocking blow 1s before Spider phase. FAP/Gnome helps, too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Snake boss</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Threat reset at 50%, save BT+taunt for after. Last stand past 50%</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bat boss</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Threat reset at 50%, save BT+taunt for after.</li>
    <li>Progression: get BS/DS up before getting silenced.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hakkar</h3>
<ul>
    <li>One of the hardest hitters on Kronos. Use GSSP, blow fear beforehand. Go more tanky than default TPS set, aim for EH.</li>
    <li>Get DS up immediately after Blood Siphon.</li>
    <li>Progression: Go full potato on both tanks and instruct DPS to stay below both tanks. Having leftover flask or wbuffs helps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>AQ20</h2>

<h3>Rajaxx</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fear break first wave.</li>
    <li>Have anti-disarm gloves on or use a weapon with weapon chain for the boss.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ossirian</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Go way tankier than your default TPS set. You plan for worst case here which is needing to bridge Supreme mode with no crystal up.</li>
    <li>Try to keep SA and DS up.</li>
    <li>Shield before the knockback or when you dip.</li>
    <li>Alliance: Zin'Malor trinket</li>
    <li>I personally prefer passive trinkets here, maybe LGG on Horde</li>
    <li>Progression: Go full potato.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ayamiss</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Have anti-disarm gloves on or use a weapon with weapon chain for the boss.</li>
</ul>

<h2>AQ40</h2>

<h2>Naxxramas</h2>

<h3>Anub</h3>

<h3>Faerlina</h3>

<h3>Maexxna</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Probably the most technical fight for a tank in Naxx. High variance in gear/trinket selection between progression/no wbuffs and 1-phase (kill before 1st web spray)</li>
    <li>If 1phase: regular TPS set with Kiss</li>
    <li>Death Wish+GSSP on pull, maybe sapper</li>
    <li>Progression: Go full potato, dual wield on pull</li>
</ol>
