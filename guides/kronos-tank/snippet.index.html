<h1>Kronos Tanking Compendium</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<ul>
    <li>On race selection: For 98% of players human/orc are the best choice. Troll works too for top guild MTs getting fed or if you have beaten the game (= obtained THC+TF). Gnome is a valid choice if you intend to gear through PvP (r13 is valid tank set for majority of content, esp. if augmented with defensive offpieces for certain encounters, r14 weaps work till Naxx/KT). UD is nice for Nef/Ony due to additional fear break. Dwarf is also nice for certain encounters. Remember there's a time-component to the game and humans/orcs/gnome just breeze through the game faster than other races, so it's easier to stay ahead of the curve.</li>
    <li>On talents: PvP Arms or Furyimpale for leveling/dungeon content. 1-2 furyprot tanks for raids.</li>
    <li>On weapon speed: doesn't matter much outside of Vael/Thaddius where you got more rage than you can dump. Generally, two fast weapons are more reliable/consistent and slower weapons have a higher variance. If undergeared/underbuffed, fast weapons can actually hinder you if you don't generate enough rage with a signle hit to use e.g. Revenge or SA. Ideally, use weapons you have at least +5 weapon skill with.</li>
    <li>General skill priorities as furyprot: rage pooled with HS queued, BT > Revenge > Sunder armor/BS to dump rage. As OT spam sunder after the initial BT to bind your mob, keep DS up.</li>
    <li>As full epic warrior without a shield has the same amount of armor as a full-blue/preraid BiS warrior with a shield.</li>
    <li>There is no "aoe tanking" in Vanilla: For the few AoE packs (Garr adds, BWL gobbos/whelps, AQ40 warriors, Naxx spiders), you have sappers and AoE taunt (mb engi shield). You can at most bind 2-3 mobs and more shouldn't be needed either.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leveling / Dungeons</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Best tanked as Armas or Furyimpale specs due to having both TM and PH.</li>
    <li>SA is your friend, try to mark mobs. Build threat on a different mob than skull, let DPS nuke skull and taunt skull. This way you can bind 2-3 mobs.</li>
    <li>Kite groups of mobs with PH, PH also buys you time to taunt before e.g. Strat UD ghoul packs reach ranged DPS</li>
