<h1>Kronos Tanking Compendium</h1>

<p>
    <i>WIP Drak brain dumb, please keep in mind. Haven't checked back with any other tanks like Alio or Jebu, yet.</i>
</p>

<p>On <b>Classic vs. Kronos</b>: In comparison, Classic tanking is a joke. On Kronos most stuff feels like it hits harder, this is partially due to mob ability spam and something being off with melee combat in general (e.g. dodge/avoidance is way more consistent on Classic, thrashing and parry-hasting and general weird dmg spikes are way more common on Kronos. On Classic you also don't need more than 6% hit due to HS queueing (assuming you have at least +5 weap skill), so you gear differently.</p>

<p>On <b>Alliance vs. Horde</b>: Alliance tanking is easier with BoK, BoS, BoP, Fearward, DI. Horde has an edge on certain encounters with Chain Heal and Poison cleanse totem, but this doesn't affect tanking much. On Horde you can't outthreat BiS warriors with windfury if they aren't playing along in critical/unlucky situations (e.g. by using fetish, petri flask, LIP or target dummies).</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<ul>
    <li>On <b>race</b> selection: For 98% of players human/orc are the best choice. Troll works too for top guild MTs getting fed or if you have beaten the game (= obtained THC+TF). Gnome is a valid choice if you intend to gear through PvP (r13 is valid tank set for majority of content, esp. if augmented with defensive offpieces for certain encounters, r14 weaps work till Naxx/KT). UD is nice for Nef/Ony due to additional fear break. Dwarf is also nice for certain encounters. Remember there's a time-component to the game and humans/orcs/gnome just breeze through the game faster than other races, so it's easier to stay ahead of the curve.</li>
    <li>On <b><a href="../../talents.html">talents</a></b>: PvP Arms or Furyimpale for leveling/dungeon content. 1-2 Furyprot tanks for raids.</li>
    <li>On <b>weapon speed</b>: doesn't matter much outside of Vael/Thaddius where you got more rage than you can dump. Generally, two fast weapons are more reliable/consistent and slower weapons have a higher variance, meaning worst- and best-case are more extreme. If undergeared/underbuffed, fast weapons can actually hinder you if you don't generate enough rage with a single hit to use e.g. Revenge or SA. Ideally, use weapons you have at least +5 weapon skill with.</li>
    <li>On BiS/default TPS gear: get 2 pieces T3 for revenge bonus (good T3 pieces are bracers, head, boots, chest and ring). Maximize stamina, armor (= effective health, EH) and DPS stats, 45-55 +def, 10-12% +hit. Too much +def reduces you enrage uptime, thus threat. You want to find the sweet spot of not getting crit-crushed to death and getting crit regularly for enrage.</li>
    <li>General ability priorities as Furyprot: rage pooled with HS queued, BT > Revenge > Sunder armor/BS to dump rage. As OT spam sunder after the initial BT to bind your mob, keep DS up.</li>
    <li>As full epic warrior without a shield has the same amount of armor as a full-blue/preraid BiS warrior with a shield.</li>
    <li>There is no "aoe tanking" in Vanilla: For the few AoE packs (Garr adds, BWL gobbos/whelps, AQ40 warriors, Naxx spiders), you have sappers and AoE taunt (mb engi shield). You can at most bind 2-3 mobs and more shouldn't be needed either.</li>
    <li>Generally, you want to dual wield as much as possible. Have dual wield and 1H+Shield keybound and ideally on the other hand as your ability spam (e.g. I have weapon/gear switch on left keyboard hand and majority of abilities on right mouse hand). If you dip hard, switch to 1H+Shield immediately. <b>Use the same MH in your dual wield setup as well as in your 1H+Shield setup so you don't trigger GCD when switching weapons.</b></li>
    <li>Nearly all encounters you want to pop your TPS/DPS CDs on pull (mostly Death Wish and CD trinkets), maybe Sapper/holy water/dense dynamite if you see fit.</li>
    <li>4 main consumable buffs you want to have up at all times: mongoose, green juju, black juju (alt: Firewater), dumplings (alt: sunfruit, stam food). Use Juju Flurry, Oil of Immolation for extra ooomph. Juju Escape if you still have bagspace.</li>
    <li>Zanza and BL buff (str/agi) at least on you, if not prepopped (if you have the logistics), Gift of Arthas also helps if you have buff slots. Cancel your track herbs/veins buff by right-clicking it on the minimap.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More on BiS Gear by Slot</h2>

<p>
    You got lots of options gearing as a tank, most important is having full epic armor and epic weapons.
    Despite the good AQ40 offpieces (gloves, belt, shoulders), T3 has the highest EH. So if it comes hard-on-hard and maximum potato is required, use T3.
    Remember, that stat budget per item level diminishes for items having fewer stats compared to items having multiple stats. This makes items like T2.5 legs/shoulders, Mentor's, Don Julio's, Twins belt, Rage of Mugamba, Ossi xbow or Ocean's Breeze so great value.
    The majority of time you will be running something like the following though (I call this the "TPS" set in this guide):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Head: T3 or T2.5 or r13. Progression: skip LHH, go straight for T1/T2/r10, save Arcanite for TF or gold for epic mount.</li>
    <li>Neck: Stormrage or Barbed for TPS, Cthun neck for max. potato. ZG set neck and Ony neck are great starters. Skeram neck and Sadist's Collar are fine as well. AV neck, DMF neck are great catch-ups.</li>
    <li>Shoulder: T2.5 or r13. T3 or Unrelenting for potato.</li>
    <li>Cloak: Cthun Eye cloak, Concentrated Hatred, Cloak of the Scourge, AQ20 set cloak. ZG hit cloak is fine, too.</li>
    <li>Chest: T2.5 or r13. Use T3 chest if you need hit (e.g. no DFT) or T3 set bonus.</li>
    <li>Bracers: T3. Vengeance work, too.</li>
    <li>Gloves: GoA, Steadfast, r12 work.</li>
    <li>Belt: Mentor, Royal Qiraji Belt.</li>
    <li>Legs: T2.5 or r12.</li>
    <li>Boots: Chromatics or r12 or T3.</li>
    <li>Rings: Plenty of options, anything epic with melee stats works.</li>
    <li>Trinkets: Kiss, DFT, Slayer's, MotChamp/Chosen, LGG, ZG set trinket, Styleen's, Diamond Flask, Earthstrike.</li>
</ul>

<p>More threat can be achieved in pure DPS gear, which may be suitable for instances you outgear.</p>

<h2>Leveling / Dungeons</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Best tanked as Arms or Furyimpale specs due to having both TM and PH.</li>
    <li>SA is your friend, try to mark mobs. Build threat on a different mob than skull, let DPS nuke skull and taunt skull. This way you can bind 2-3 mobs.</li>
    <li>Kite groups of mobs with PH, PH also buys you time to taunt before e.g. Strat UD ghoul packs reach ranged DPS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Molten Core</h2>

<h3>Magmadar</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Open with Death Wish, avoid subsequent fears with Berserker Rage/Fearward</li>
    <li>Progression: Use shield/Draconian Deflector at all times, GSSP</li>
</ul>

<h3>Majordomo</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Maybe not use TF with spellreflect.</li>
    <li>Progression: go full potato as Elite OT.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ragnaros</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ideally have 315 FR. Death Wish ~8s before start, MRP on start.</li>
    <li>ZG rage trinket helps too get rage before encounter starts.</li>
    <li>Progression: Get BRS FR buff, don't Death Wish on pull, GFPP before pull, MRP on start, use Draconian Deflector</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="../ony/">Onyxia</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Start with MRP on pull, use CD trinket in P1, DW upon landing P3, use 2nd CD trinket P3 if you have. 2H+Slam in P2, keep SA up in P2 (if no EA rogue).</li>
    <li>On threat reset through fireballs isn't really working on Kronos. P1 tank almost never gets to pickup on P3 regardless of what's done in P2.</li>
    <li>Progression: Use shield/Draconian Deflector, mb some FR pieces, shield block/defensive CDs after breaths. It's great to have 2nd tank stay mid-level on KTM till P2/P3, so 2nd tank is likely to pick it up in P3.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blackwing Lair</h2>

<h3>Razorgore the Untamed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Full potato + shield if you are (last to) controlling the orb and thus tanking the boss.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Vaelastrasz the Corrupt</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Time the following CDs so that the last GCD goes off right before encounter starts:<br>
        Zerker Stance > Blood Rage > BS > Diamond Flask (if you got ES/Kiss/Slayer's use those instead and skip this) > Death Wish > Recklessness > Def stance > MRP (+ES/Kiss/Slayer's if you didn't use Diamond Flask)
    </li>
    <li>If you have a fast weapon, use it in MH.</li>
    <li>Progression: Don't use Recklessness and you likely have no active trinket, maybe use some FR</li>
</ul>

<h3>Broodlord Lashlayer</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use TPS gear, swap 2 pieces for high EH pieces, use Death Wish + GSSP + CD trinket on pull</li>

</ul>

<h3>Firemaw</h3>

    <li>Get ready to pick it up ca. 3-5s after 3rd big guy spawns.</li>
    <li>Shield after shadow flame, shield for warrior call.</li>
    <li>Dmg variance is high on this encounter: it ranges from def stance+shield to Berserker stance + Recklessness up to break fear. In that case you may want to cancel Recklessness prematurely.</li>
    <li>Use GSSP, esp. when dual wielding.</li>
    <li>OT or 2nd warrior on threat may position on opposite side of boss in case MT folds or gets feared.</li>
    <li>Progression: be tanky, maybe even full-potato on Horde, GSSP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zul'Gurub</h2>

<h3>Buru the Gorger</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Ayamiss</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Have anti-disarm gloves on or use a weapon with weapon chain for the boss.</li>
</ul>

<h2>AQ40</h2>

<h3>Skeram</h3>

<h3>Bug Trio</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Yauj reset threat even if you are immune to the fear, interrupt her heals</li>
    <li>1-2 warriors on Yauj, 1-2 warriors on Vem, MT on Kri, 1 warrior AoE taunt adds after Yauj death</li>

    <li>Progression: you need to tank swap, boss is tauntable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Naxxramas</h2>

<p>You want to keep DS up on basically anything in Naxx.</p>

<h3>Anub'Rekhan</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Standard TPS gear, might even go more threaty if priests/shamans proc inspiration. Dmg can definitely be spiky, so either use GSSP or be attentive with 1H+Shield swapping/LS.</li>
    <li>Add tanks: nothing special, stack mobs on boss for cleave. Use FAP before pull if you think, you'll have problems positioning. MRP works too if mob runs off. Add hitbox can be wonky.</li>
    <li>Progression/mechanics: go slightly tankier than TPS and save pot CD for swiftness pot or use Nifty's. Position boss ahead of locust swarm so you can start running on the outer ring. Activate speed CD when Locust Swarm is casting and run, avoid green goo.</li>
    <li>Progression add tank: keep adds separately from boss and nuke adds first. Assist tank may be really threaty.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grand Widow Faerlina</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Boss: TPS gear, dual wield, death wish + GSSP on pull</li>
    <li>Add tanks: should/can bind at most two effectively, 1H+Shield + AoE taunt + Sapper + LGG on pull works too</li>
</ul>

<h3>Maexxna</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Probably the most technical fight for a tank in Naxx. High variance in gear/trinket selection between progression/no wbuffs and 1-phase (kill before 1st web spray)</li>
    <li>If 1phase: regular TPS set with Kiss</li>
    <li>Death Wish+GSSP on pull, maybe sapper</li>
    <li>Progression: Go full potato, dual wield on pull</li>
</ul>

<h3>Noth the Plaguebringer</h3>
<ul>
    <li>With wbuffs out, no need to flask here, yet.</li>
    <li>Death wish on pull, MRP when rage is dumped.</li>
    <li>2nd tank wants to pop death wish late (before blink) or with DPS.</li>
    <li>Progression: Boss is immune for ca. 1s after coming back from the balcony, so use BT after.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Heigan the Unclean</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pop flask latest here, death wish + GSSP on pull.</li>
    <li>Maybe pop sapper/holy water on pull if dodge-parry on pull.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Loatheb</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Go full potato, maybe 1-2 offensive pieces at most depending on raid composition. Use LGG + DFT or MotChamp. Pool rage beforehand. Dual wield, death wish and sapper/holy water on pull.</li>
    <li>Progression: full potato, even 2nd trinket defensive</li>
</ul>

<h3>Patchwerk</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hateful soakers: max. stam/EH, dodge trinkets.</li>
    <li>MT, no wbuffs: full potato, offensive trinkets (Kiss/Earthstrike/Slayer's, DFT or MotC). Death wish on pull.</li>
    <li>MT, wbuffs: AQ40 pieces are great (T2.5 + offpieces, 80-100 +def), offensive trinkets (Kiss/Earthstrike/Slayer's, DFT or MotC). Death wish on pull. On Horde I wouldn't dual wield.</li>
    <li>MT: sapper/holywater on pull.</li>
    <li>Titans and GSSP up on all tanks at all times.</li>
    <li>Progression: full potato (mostly T2), defensive trinkets on all tanks. MT: don't death wish.</li>
    <li>Horde: If you are struggling, take "Razorhide" buff from Camp Taurajo.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grobbulus</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pool rage on critters beforehand.</li>
    <li>Death wish + GSSP on pull, use MRP instead of boss runs off.</li>
    <li>Backpedal is your friend here, don't run out of his melee range esp. he's casting.</li>
    <li>Move the boss after poison cloud (chicken icon popping up from BigWigs).</li>
    <li>Mind the slime spray timer: don't face boss to raid or have people infront of him when it's about to happen. While the timer is running it's safe to turn him.</li>
    <li>OTs taunting slimes: don't accidentially taunt the boss!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gluth</h3>
<ul>
    <li>TPS gear with some 2-3 slots switched out for tanky items.</li>
    <li>Shield on pull, MRP + shield or GSSP + dual wield both work, use shield when Tranq shots are late or you got a solid threat lead.</li>
    <li>If you don't have Fearward, you don't want to pop Death Wish on pull but instead pop it just before first Fear.</li>
    <li>Progression/no world buffs: Align tank swap with OT, I'd recommend breaking the first 3 Fears (2 via Death Wish, 1 via Berserker Rage), OT breaks first fear via BR, 2nd + 3rd via Death Wish, 4th fear via BR, then alternate BRs between tanks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thaddius</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Stalagg (left side add, near 100% crush chance): 4 piece T3, use shield. Pool rage with ZG trinket beforehand.</li>
    <li>Feugen (right side add): TPS set, maybe MRP on pull.</li>
    <li>P1 Taunters: 4 piece T3 or full potato.</li>
    <li>Pool rage for Thaddius before adds are dead.</li>
    <li>Switch to TPS set on phase transition, GSSP when Thaddius becomes active. Death wish + CD trinket after first polarity buff is up.</li>
    <li>Make sure to never leave Thaddius' melee range when switching polarities or taunting back. Otherwise you'll get nuked for 9k+.</li>
    <li>Progression: Add taunters may use Reel to secure taunt.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructor Razuvious</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 piece T3, disarm adds once released.</li>
    <li>Progression: Close to full potato, Shield Wall + Taunt boss if things go sideways, reposition.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gothik the Harvester</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Live side: Ideally Furyprot tank (= without Deep Wounds talent) on the platform where adds get shackled/sheeped.</li>
    <li>Live side: Boss is immune for ca. 1s when he shows up, pop Death Wish beforehand.</li>
    <li>Dead side: Tank horses, be alert to switch to shield.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Four Horsemen</h3>
<ul>
    <li>TODO</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sapphiron</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Go full potato, maybe 1-2 offensive or mixed-use pieces like Loatheb.</li>
    <li>With wbuffs and gear: death wish, dual wield, sapper/holy water on pull. 1H+Shield when dipping.</li>
    <li>I prefer passive trinkets like DFT and Styleen's here, esp. since they don't cost at least one additional buff slot like MotC. But anything you got (Kiss, Slayer's, MotChamp/Chosen, LGG) works really.</li>
    <li>Be aware of your CDs: LS, health stone, shield wall, maybe LGG.</li>
    <li>GSSP up at all times.</li>
    <li>Run out of Blizzard, move boss if needed.</li>
    <li>Switch to 2H and Slam in air phase, weave in SA if you don't have imp. EA rogue.</li>
    <li>Maybe run after 4th block already to be safe.</li>
    <li>Horde: If you are struggling, take "Razorhide" buff from Camp Taurajo.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kel'Thuzad</h3>
<ul>
    <li>P1: DS + 5 Sunders on Abos, maybe taunt and run if stuns are unreliable</li>
    <li>Blow fear end of P1.</li>
    <li>Boss pickup: Pop Death Wish 8-10s before boss becomes active, use GSSP, position boss.</li>
    <li>Other tanks: Pop Death Wish or/and CD trinket before 1st Mind Control.</li>
    <li>P3 add tanks: pump a bit threat into add, then Hamstring or PH kite, use maybe 1-2 epic FrR pieces.</li>
</ul>
