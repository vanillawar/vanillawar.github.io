<h1>WoW Classic PvP Pool Size Boosting</h1>

<p>
    Boosting the PvP pool size is the single smartest thing any ranker can do to progress faster.
    It is always more beneficial than farming "x" amount of additional honor.
    This can be done by getting at least 15 honorable kills (HK) on an alt.
    The level of characters getting the kills does not matter. For a character to grant HKs, it needs to be at least lvl10.

</p>
<p>
    Simply speaking,
    every 333 additional players yield an additional br1 spot (min. needed for r14),
    every 200 additional players yield an additional br2 spot (min. needed for r13),
    every 83 additional players yield an additional br3 spot (min. needed for r12),
    every 67 additional players yield an additional br4 spot (min. needed for r11),
    every 40 additional players yield an additional br5 spot (min. needed for r10) etc.

<h2>For Organizers</h2>

<ul>
    <li>On a PvP server, you need another account to provide the "victim" of the opposite faction. The characters need to be lvl5 at least</li>
    <li>Have a high-level character of your faction on the graveyard killing the lowbie faster (recommended: fury warrior, rogue, hunter + pet)</li>
    <li>Have one character on the spot, that invites people and forms a steady raid group. This can also be the high-level character</li>
    <li>Helpful add-on for invite keywords: <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic" target="_blank">Leatrix Plus</a> (turn it on in the settings, by default whispering "inv" invites people)</li>
    <li>Have a macro with text invite instructions + a "thank you!" on the invite character</li>
    <li>You can have max. 10 characters per server and 50 characters per account. Making deals with players of other servers to cross-server boost the pool size is highly recommended!</li>
    <li>Have a schedule, spread the word and announce the <emph>exact graveyard location</emph>! ;)</li>
</ul>

Useful macro the opposite faction character getting killed:

<pre>/click StaticPopup1Button1
/tar Spirit Healer
/run AcceptXPLoss()
