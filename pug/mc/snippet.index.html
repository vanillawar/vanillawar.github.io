<h2>Loot Rules</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Item counters; if it makes sense for your class, you can roll it. (item counters = people that won less items have prio)</li>
    <li>Counter reset before Rag/BoE rolls at the end.</li>
    <li>Cores/Essences split among people w/o any loot at the end.</li>
    <li>Legendaries/Recipes auctioned in the raid, 100% split via mail (min: 1k per Binding, 2k Eye, 400 recipe).</li>
    <li>Ingots will be saved and are included for Sulf Eye.</li>
</ol>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Q: What are "item counters"?<b><br>
        A: I note every player who receives an item. Players who won less items have priority over others in the same raid (sometimes this is called "+1 rule", but this has been misused a lot).
        Some items are so bad, that players usually do not want to "waste their roll". The following items are not counted:
        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        When <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20725/nexus-crystal" data-wowhead="item=20725&amp;domain=classic" target="_blank">nexus-crystal</a> are in the game, this exception is canceled.
        The item would then get disenchanted and the crystals distributed alongside the cores/essences at the end.

        <b>Q: I can douse runes in MC. Do I get a special reward?</b><br>
        A: No, enabling Domo + Rag encounters is reward in itself, the whole raid still needs to kill those.

        <b>Q: Who are you? How can we trust you?</b><br>
        A: I'm <a href="https://www.vanillawar.com/about.html">Drak/Drakon</a>. I re-introduced the world to proper Vanilla pugging incl. GDKP on Feenix pserver, from where it eventually spread to other pservers. I transparently redistributed ~5 Million gold on Alliance alone.
