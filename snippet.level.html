        <h2>General Tips</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Keep <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25289/battle-shout" data-wowhead="spell=25289&amp;domain=classic" target="_blank">battle-shout</a> up and get used to it for the rest of your Warrior life!</li>
          <li>Grind green mobs along the way, scout for chests, do kill quests, use rested bonus (log out in inns/capital cities)</li>
          <li>Pick and level Skinning and your non-Engineering (final moneymaker) profession during leveling. Sell leather and keep some for leveling Engineering later</li>
          <li>At lvl16 and above you are fine to tank dungeons, regardless of spec as long as you have a one-handed weapon, a shield and Tactical Mastery</li>
          <li>Do not buy items off the AH or vendors, save the gold to get your 60% mount (you probably won't get it at lvl40 right away without friends lending)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="talents">Talents</h2>

    <img src="static/talents-leveling-pve.jpg" alt="31/20/0 leveling spec" />
    <p>
      31/20/0 Arms is best for leveling. It provides damage value on every tier compared to Fury, which only yields <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12856/cruelty" data-wowhead="spell=12856&amp;domain=classic" target="_blank">cruelty</a>
      on the 1st tier and has a drought till the 4th tier (<a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13048/enrage" data-wowhead="spell=13048&amp;domain=classic" target="_blank">enrage</a>). Arms also includes <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12679/tactical-mastery" data-wowhead="spell=12679&amp;domain=classic" target="_blank">tactical-mastery</a> which is great
      for tanking in dungeons and world PvP.
    </p>
    <p>
      First 31 points into Arms:
      <ol>
        <li>3/3 Improved Rend</li>
        <li>2/5 Deflection</li>
        <li>2/2 Improved Charge (or take 2 points Tactical Master first, if you intend to start tanking already)</li>
        <li>3/5 Tactical Mastery</li>
        <li>2/2 Improved Overpower</li>
        <li>3/3 Deep Wounds</li>
        <li>2/2 Impale</li>
        <li>2/5 Two-Handed Weapon Specialization</li>
        <li>4/5 Tactical Mastery</li>
        <li>1/1 Sweeping Strikes</li>
        <li>5/5 Axe Specialization</li>
        <li>5/5 Two-Handed Weapon Specialization</li>
        <li>5/5 Tactical Mastery</li>
        <li>1/1 Mortal Strike</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the last 20 points into Fury:
      <ol>
        <li>5/5 Cruelty</li>
        <li>5/5 Booming Voice</li>
        <li>1/1 Piercing Howl</li>
        <li>3/3 Blood Craze</li>
        <li>1/5 Improved Battle Shout</li>
        <li>5/5 Enrage</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Axe spec is always preferred while leveling, even if you do not always have an axe. You have some freedom with the Tactical
      Mastery, Two-Handed Weapon Specialization, Improved Charge and Improved Hamstring talents (indicated by *).
      If you do not (need to) kite or you play on a PvE server, you may want to skip Improved Hamstring completely.
      In the Fury tree, you may also want to substitute Booming Voice with Unbridled Wrath and Blood Craze with more points in Improved Battle Shout (again indicated by *).
