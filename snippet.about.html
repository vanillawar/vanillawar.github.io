  <h2>Hey, I'm Drak</h2>
  <p>
    I played Vanilla WoW since the closed US beta and quit retail before the first WotLK content patch. During retail Vanilla
    I achieved r12 on Alliance and cleared all content till 4HM (4HM, Sapph, KT one week after TBC release). After some WoW
    break, I picked up Vanilla WoW again via the emulation scene. There I achieved 2 r13 warriors (Orc/NE) with all content
    cleared. I also played warriors of all races but UD/Gnome, some of which I ranked to r10.

    On this website I want to share my in-depth knowledge of the warrior class and Vanilla WoW in general.
