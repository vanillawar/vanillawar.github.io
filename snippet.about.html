    <h2>Hey, I'm Drak</h2>

    <p>
      I played Vanilla WoW (now re-released as "WoW Classic") since the closed US beta and quit retail before the first WotLK content patch.
      During retail Vanilla, I achieved r12 on Alliance and cleared all content till 4HM (4HM, Sapph, KT one week after TBC release).
      After some WoW break, I picked up Vanilla WoW again via the emulation scene.
      There I achieved two r13 warriors (Orc/NE) with all content cleared.
      I also played warriors of all races but UD/Gnome, some of which I ranked to r10.

      Early 2012, I introduced the emulation scene to an adapted GDKP system to fuel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130311022541/http://www.wow-one.com/blog/06/interview-drakon/" target="_blank">my PuGs</a>.
      Eventually, I led a few hundred 20/40man PuGs across both factions, GDKP became popular across the scene and other servers, where people exploited it to the point of it getting banned. ;)

    <p>
      Classic: r13, TF, all content clear with Inevitable PuG on EU Gehennas. RIP, unsubbed and back to pservers?!
